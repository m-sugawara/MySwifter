# Twitter Client for practice

## What is this?

This is the simple Twitter client app.  
  
This project is my first Swift project. When I tried to develop this project, I only had known very basic things. So, almost every code of this project is terrible.  
  
But I noticed that fixing this project might improve my skill. This is the reason why I have been fixing this entire project.  
  
It will be a long journey because there are a lot of crappy and buggy codes. It is exciting that I will have a lot of opportunities to learn from my old codes!
